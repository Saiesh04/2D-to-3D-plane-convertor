# RenderRidge

### Abstract
Develop software that converts 2D blueprints of buildings into 3D walkthrough models for NSG operations, enhancing situational awareness and efficiency.

### SIH Info
- Problem Statement ID – 1773
- Problem Statement Title – Conversion of 2D Blueprints into 3D Model
- Theme – Smart Automation
- PS Category – Software
- Team ID – 21329
- Team Name – Identifier Expected

### Technologies:
- **Programming languages:** Python  
- **3D rendering and Walkthrough:** Unity  
- **Python libraries:** OpenCV, Numpy, Pillow, Pythreejs, Trimesh, Pyglet, Flet  

### Methodology:
- **Blueprint Input:** User uploads 2D plans and building parameters.
- **3D Conversion:** The software processes input and creates a 3D walkthrough.
- **Integration:** Includes offline maps and satellite imagery.
- **Output:** Provides a fully interactive 3D model for briefings.

### Requirements
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` should contain:

```
opencv-python
numpy
pythreejs
flet
trimesh
Pillow
pyglet
```

### Installation and Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kevin-ai-04/sih_2024.git
   cd 3D_Floors
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the program:**
   After installing the requirements, you can run the program by executing:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Blueprint input:**  
   Upload your 2D blueprint when prompted and follow the instructions to set building parameters.

5. **Generate 3D model:**  
   The software will automatically generate the 3D model based on the input provided.

6. **View 3D walkthrough:**  
   Open the generated 3D model in Unity (or other 3D viewer) to explore the walkthrough model.
